+ *Create an API using at least 2 related models, one of which should be a user*
+ *Include all major CRUD functions in a RESTful API for at least one of those models*
+ *Consume your own API by making your front-end with HTML, Javascript, & jQuery*
+ *Add authentication to your API to restrict access to appropriate users*
+ **Craft thoughtful user stories together, as a team**
+ **Manage team contributions and collaboration using a standard Git flow on GitHub**
+ **Layout and style your front-end with clean & well-formatted CSS**
+ **Deploy your application online so it's publically accessible**



##Necessary Deliverables

+ *A working API, built by the whole team, hosted somewhere on the internet*
